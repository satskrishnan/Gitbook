# AWS Certification

## Day 1

Today is day 1 for the preparation of the AWS Certified cloud practitioner (CLF-C01).&#x20;

I'm quite familiar with the basic concepts of cloud computing. I've also completed the MS Azure Fundamental; I believe I can have a jump start on this certification preparation.&#x20;

Today my focus is to complete the Udemy course Guided Video Walkthrough for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C01 by Neal Davis.

Below is the course link in udemy.

Udemy is available as part of my organization training program. Udemy access enables me to access almost all courses in udemy for free. Find this as very useful to prepare for certification.



## Additional Exam Preparation

In addition to the above courses, I've also taken the foundation course in Linux academy. Mainly the exam part and then covered the week areas.&#x20;

With more practice and I was able to clear the exam.&#x20;

Now I'm an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.
